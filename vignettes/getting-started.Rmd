Cointoss is a small R package that simulates fair coin tosses and analyzes the outcomes.

It was developed by Andreas Pedersen and Elissa Yammin as part of a university assignment to demonstrate an R package with S3 methods, plotting, testing, and documentation.

Use toss_coin(n) to simulate n fair coin tosses.

```{}
my_toss <- toss_coin(100)
```
The print() method shows a short summary:
```{}
print(my_toss)
```
The summary() method gives you the proportion of Heads and Tails:
```{}
summary(my_toss)
```
Bar Plot of Heads vs. Tails
```{}
plot(my_toss)  # default is bar plot
```
See how your tosses evolve over time:
```{}
plot(my_toss, type = "path")
```
This plot increases by +1 for Heads, and decreases by -1 for Tails.

```{r setup}
library(Cointoss)
```
